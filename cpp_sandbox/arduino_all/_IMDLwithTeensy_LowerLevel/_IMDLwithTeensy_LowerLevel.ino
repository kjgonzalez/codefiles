Main Objective: create lower-level hardware 
  for IMDL robot, "Wanderbot". this robot 
  will use the teensy 3.1 development board
  in order to receive commands / information
  from the beaglebone, send motor commands, 
  read IR sensors, and receive SOME info from 
  GPIO switches.

/*
things to keep in mind: 
3.3v logic level, 5V pin tolerant (some)
72 MHz clock (comes overclocking)
34 IO pins (total)
"21" analog inputs (doubtful...?)
12 PWM pins available
3 UART, 2 I2C, 1 SPI
