mtotal = mextra + msoil + mwater=pct*msoil
mtotal = mextra + msoil*(1+pct)
mtotal = mextra=150 + msoil*(1+pct)
assume mextra = 150g

(mtotal-150) / (1+pct) = msoil
plasticplate=30g, x5 (x1 plate, x2 pot, x2 plant+sensor)

sensor calibration plan
1. gather 1.5kg mixed dirt
2. dry the dirt in the oven, in the ceramic tray
3. set oven to 110degC, bake for 1hr or until soil fully dried
4. measure soil mass, keep only 1kg
5. measure dry soil with sensor
5. for given step size of 5%: 
    a. add 5% of soil mass as water => 50g water
    b. mix soil & water (dirt)
    c. measure dirt mixture with sensor
    d. repeat until satisfied
6. create plot to correlate the values
