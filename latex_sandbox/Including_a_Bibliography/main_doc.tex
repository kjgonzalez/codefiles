How to render the bibliography in a latex document: 

\begin{enumerate}
%\itemsep=-0.25em

\item Create main *.txt document (like this one)
\item Create bibliography *.bib document (like the references.bib file)
\item The bottom of your document (or wherever you want your references to show up), include ``bibliographystyle'' and ``bibliography'' tags. note that you don't put the ``.bib'' extension in the tag
\item In order to render properly (assuming you're using texworks), change the compile option from ``pdfLaTeX'' to ``BibTeX''
\item Render as ``BibTeX'' (perhaps two or three times)
\item Switch back to ``pdfLaTeX'' and render as ``pdfLaTeX''
\item Render AGAIN as ``pdfLaTeX'' and you should have a bibliography AND all correct citations
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{KEEP IN MIND:} stuff only gets included in the references / bibliography section if you tag it in ``cite'' or ``nocite'' somewhere in your document


% hello world \cite{ab94} this is a test.
\nocite{Birdetal2001}
\nocite{ab94}


% BIBLIOGRAPHY =================================================================
\bibliographystyle{plain}
\bibliography{references}
