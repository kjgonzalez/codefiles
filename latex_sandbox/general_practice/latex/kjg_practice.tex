This section can be used as commenting?

some objectives of learning to use latex: 
* title %done
* table of contents %done
* figures / tables %done
* equations %done
* bullets / numbered lists % done
* changing fonts (monospace) %done
* in-text math % done
* special symbols (math or stuff like Ã¼) % done
* sections %done
* section numbering %done
* paragraph formatting (hanging/firstline/justified/right/etc) % will not pursue
* authors
* bold / italics / underline / etc
* referencing
* citing / cross referencing
* appendices 

= notes / questions while learning:  =======================
* what about multiple authors in the title?
* can't seem to continue page numbering in the middle of a document when have been turned off
* in order to deal with subsections beyond a depth of 3 (e.g. x.x.x.x), check out modifying paragraph: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/60209/how-to-add-an-extra-level-of-sections-with-headings-below-subsubsection
* why isn't the first paragraph of each section being automatically indented? 
* to control spacing in a list: %\itemsep=-0.5em % this is the correct way to reduce the spaces in a list... :)
* continuous / persection caption numbering: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/28333/continuous-v-per-chapter-section-numbering-of-figures-tables-and-other-docume
* maybe be possible to embed python code directly in a latex document: http://www.texample.net/weblog/2008/oct/24/embedding-python-latex/
