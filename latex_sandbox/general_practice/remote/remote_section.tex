This is the start of the remote section. note that the text begins immediately where the \textbackslash input command is given. We can treat this section just like any other. The other method to use is \textbackslash include, but the big difference here is that it adds a page break. that's not really necessary until you're writing book-length items. with \textbackslash input, you can pretty much treat it as if it were part of the main document, such as with references:

\begin{itemize}
\item Table \ref{Mathematical Symbols} exists behind this document
\item Subsection \ref{super duper} exists ahead of this document
\item three
\end{itemize}

Alright, end of remote section.
