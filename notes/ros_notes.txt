= HELP WITH INSTALLING ROS FROM SOURCE WITH PYTHON3 ==================
# http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Source
# https://answers.ros.org/question/295012/how-can-i-install-ros-melodic-with-python3/
# general steps, written here: (special steps are also given and annotated)
# note: cv_bridge seems to install here as well

sudo apt-get install python3-rosdep python3-rosinstall-generator python3-wstool python3-rosinstall build-essential # NOTE: ADDED '3' HERE
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
mkdir -p ~/programs/ros_catkin_ws # NOTE: personally use programs parent folder
cd ~/programs/ros_catkin_ws
# NOTE: install "ros desktop", the "recommended" version
rosinstall_generator desktop --rosdistro melodic --deps --tar > melodic-desktop.rosinstall
wstool init -j8 src melodic-desktop.rosinstall

# THIS IS THE BARE BONES VERSION: 
# rosinstall_generator ros_comm --rosdistro melodic --deps --tar > melodic-ros_comm.rosinstall
# wstool init -j8 src melodic-ros_comm.rosinstall

# NOTE: make sure that PYTHONPATH is properly updated, such as on rpi: 
# export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/
./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# for some reason, might have stuff uninstall part-way through
sudo apt-get install python3-rosdep python3-rosinstall-generator python3-wstool python3-rosinstall build-essential

# at this point, maybe everything properly installed? 
echo "source ~/programs/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# install a potentially missing dependency in python
python3 -m pip install defusedxml --user

# hopefully done at this point! run roscore just to check



= HOW TO USE ROS ACROSS TWO COMPUTERS ================================

notes: 
* get local ip address: "hostname -I" on given machine (only N.N.N.N part)
* PRE-REQUISITE: each computer must be able to ssh into the other (as needed) 
* this works across ros versions (tested between kinetic-melodic)
* if you will be using the same host and multiple computers consistently, consider saving ROS_MASTER_URI information in the bashrc folder as well

First-Time setup:
- ON MASTER COMPUTER (name "main") -----------------------------------
echo "export ROS_IP=<MAIN_IP_ADDRESS>" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://<MAIN_IP_ADDRESS>:11311" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

- ON SLAVE COMPUTER (name "remote") ----------------------------------
echo "export ROS_IP=<REMOTE_IP_ADDRESS>" >> ~/.bashrc #

Start-Up
- ON MASTER COMPUTER (name "main") -----------------------------------
roscore
# open new window
# rosrun / roslaunch / python (package / script name)

- ON SLAVE COMPUTER (name "remote") ----------------------------------
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://<MAIN_IP_ADDRESS>:11311 # IN EACH WINDOW
# rosrun / roslaunch / python (package / script name)
