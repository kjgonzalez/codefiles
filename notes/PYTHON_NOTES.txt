1. what's a way to look up all available modules???
>> maybe just searching through folders? >> ACTUALLY: "help('modules')"
idea 1: 
>> help('modules')
* note: outputs a multi-column list of names. bit of a hassle, but simple and reliable.

How to use Pip: 
Basic usage
The standard packaging tools are all designed to be used from the command line.

The following command will install the latest version of a module and its dependencies from the Python Packaging Index:

python -m pip install SomePackage

List comprehension in python: 
>>> x=range(1,6)
>>> x
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> y=[i**2 for i in x]
>>> y
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

How Jupyter works
"web application that allows a user to run live code, embed visualizations, and 
	provide explantaory text all in one place"
NOTE: jupyter is another name for ipython notebook
look like a webpage, but actually 3 components: live code, output results and 
	visualization, and rich-text formatting & media embedding

in order to run, a command would look like so: 
	cd DesiredFolder
	jupyter notebook object_detectiontutorial.ipynb
you're also able to see an intermediate state of data, meaning you can do a sort
	of helpful debugging
