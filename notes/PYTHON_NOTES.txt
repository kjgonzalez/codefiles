1. what's a way to look up all available modules???
>> maybe just searching through folders? >> ACTUALLY: "help('modules')"
idea 1: 
>> help('modules')
* note: outputs a multi-column list of names. bit of a hassle, but simple and reliable.

How to use Pip: 
Basic usage
Standard packaging tools are all designed to be used from the command line. The
    following command will install the latest version of a module and its 
    dependencies from the Python Packaging Index:
typical:   python -m pip install SomePackage --user
alternate: pip install SomePackage --user

List comprehension in python (see list_comprehension.py)
>>> x=range(1,6)
>>> x
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> y=[i**2 for i in x]
>>> y
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

How Jupyter works
"web application that allows a user to run live code, embed visualizations, and 
	provide explantaory text all in one place"
NOTE: jupyter is another name for ipython notebook
look like a webpage, but actually 3 components: live code, output results and 
	visualization, and rich-text formatting & media embedding

in order to run, a command would look like so: 
	cd DesiredFolder
	jupyter notebook object_detectiontutorial.ipynb
you're also able to see an intermediate state of data, meaning you can do a sort
	of helpful debugging

Quick note about making a print table in python (using pandas)

In [38]: body=np.array(np.round(np.random.rand(3,3)*5,2),dtype=object)
In [39]: head='one two three'.split(' ')
In [40]: rownames=['a','b','c']
In [41]: pd.DataFrame(data=body,columns=head,index=rownames)
Out[41]: 
    one   two three
a  0.52  3.97  0.43
b  0.68  4.54  4.19
c  4.16  1.73  4.54

Fix python indentation (only) to PEP8:
>> autopep8 path/to/file.py --select=E101,E121 --in-place
