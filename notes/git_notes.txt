KJG Git Notes

Initial Setup ==============================================
git config --global user.email
git config --global user.name
git config --global pull.rebase true
git config --global push.default simple

INITIALIZING A NEW BRANCH ==================================
  git branch NewBranch
  git checkout NewBranch
  (some changes get committed here)
  git push --set-upstream origin NewBranch

DELETING A BRANCH ==========================================
  git branch -d NewBranch (local)
  git push --delete NewBranch (remote)

MERGING A BRANCH ===========================================
  git merge NewBranch (must already be in main branch)

MENTIONING AN ISSUE IN A COMMIT ============================
commit <item> -m "#ISSUE_NUM: working on this thing"

UPDATE LOCATION OF REPO FOR GITHUB =========================
issue: get this message: "remote: This repository moved. 
    Please use the new location"
git remote set-url origin [https://...git]

DEAL WITH BRANCH / MERGE CONFLICTS =========================
0. (have created local and remote changes, leading to a 
    conflict when pulling new commits in)
1. manually fix issues between the two, save files*
    !!! DO NOT, ** DO NOT ** MAKE A COMMIT !!!
2. git add <affected file(s)>
3. git rebase --continue
   (issue should be resolved)

CHECKOUT A REMOTE BRANCH ===================================
git checkout BranchName #omit remotes/origin

KEEP A LOCAL BRANCH OF A REPO UPDATED WITH REMOTE MASTER ===
1. git clone repo
2. git branch NewBranchName of desired "master" version
3. commit local changes (especially if you don't plan to keep this forever)
4. git fetch
5. git rebase origin/MasterBranchName



KJG NEED TO CLARIFY TWO THINGS: 

1. can you branch a repo, make your own commits, but still get remote commits from other teams? yes, you can
2. can you git clone, make your own commits, then later branch from a specific point the past? - not preferrable
