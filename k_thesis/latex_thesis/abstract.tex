\section*{Abstract}
Robots should be able to learn skills from humans on all levels of abstraction. While much insight has been gained at the level of motor primitives, the recognition of intention in human behavior and its formal abstraction is still a challenge. This work presents a method that enables robots to learn human-demonstrated concepts on a symbolic, first-order logic based representational layer. The focus lies on the recognition of action effects, symbol grounding and concept formalization.
