# KJG Thesis: Comparison of 3D object detection with datasets of varying complexity
Working Topic: Comparison of 3D object detectino neural networks using datasets of varying complexity
Working Title: Comparison of 3D object detectino neural networks using datasets of varying complexity
Author: Kristian Gonzalez
Problem: There are many sensors available to detect objects, but which are truly necessary for "good" detection performance?
Goal: Want to detect 3D objects with as little hardware requirements as possible
Objective: Find a dataset / network that produces good detection results with as little hardware & processing as possible
Procedure: have 2/3 datasets, use 2/3 networks, tryand detect 3D bboxes
Metric: compre mAP (2 classes max) (as well as qualitative "complexity"?)
