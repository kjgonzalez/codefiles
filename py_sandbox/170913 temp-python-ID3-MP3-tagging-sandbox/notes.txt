KJG170913: using EasyID3 is a good, perhaps even great start, 
	but in order to access EVERYTHING desired, which even includes 
	modifying the year, etc.
NOTE: IF YOU USE THE FOLLOWING:
	>>> for i in track: print i
	THEN UNDERSTAND THAT THE ONLY FIELDS SHOWN ARE THOSE THAT ARE 
	NOT EMPTY!!! THIS MEANS THAT ACTUALLY SOME OF THE FIELDS CAN BE GIVEN
	INFORMATION, EVEN IF EMPTY!!! ok, super sleepy, need to continue this
	tomorrow.

so: will focus on trying to do something simmilar to the image manipulation module: create a bunch of practical, useful functions to manipulate the data easily.
