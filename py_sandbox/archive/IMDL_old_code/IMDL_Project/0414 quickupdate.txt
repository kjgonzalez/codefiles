get a moving average/stdev of the camera data, and then use that to make a decision


could go one of two ways: 
1. try fuzzy logic to make movement smoother
2. could have the camera stop the robot the moment it detects an object, then check to see if the std deviation goes down


fix the issue of hitting things, to step backward then fwd


now, going to get camera to drive the motors, to turn the robot to the object it wants to face


"sudo crontab"
/etc sudo nano rc.local
