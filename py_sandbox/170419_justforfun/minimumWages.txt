1Like the federal wage and hour law, State law often exempts particular occupations or industries from the minimum labor standard generally applied to covered employment. Particular exemptions are not identified in this table. Users are encouraged to consult the laws of particular States in determining whether the State's minimum wage applies to a particular employment. This information often may be found at the websites maintained by State labor departments. Links to these websites are available at www.dol.gov/whd/contacts/state_of.htm.
2The overtime premium rate is one and one-half times the employee's regular rate, unless otherwise specified.

The state minimum wage rate requirements, or lack thereof, are generally controlled by legislative activities within the individual states.
Four states - Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota - approved minimum wage increases through ballot measures in the 2014 election.
Federal minimum wage law supersedes state minimum wage laws where the federal minimum wage is greater than the state minimum wage. In those states where the state minimum wage is greater than the federal minimum wage, the state minimum wage prevails.
There are 2 states than have a minimum wage set lower than the federal minimum wage. There are 29 states plus DC with minimum wage rates set higher than the federal minimum wage. There are 14 states that have a minimum wage requirement that is the same as the federal minimum wage requirement. The remaining 5 states do not have an established minimum wage requirement.
The District of Columbia has the highest minimum wage at $9.50/hour. The states of Georgia and Wyoming have the lowest minimum wage ($5.15/hour) of the 45 states that have a minimum wage requirement.
Note: There are 10 states (AZ, CO, FL, MO, MT, NJ, NV, OH, OR, and WA) that have minimum wages that are linked to a consumer price index. As a result of this linkage, the minimum wages in these states are normally increased each year, generally around January 1st. The exception is Nevada which adjusts in the month of July each year. Effective January 1, 2015, 9 of the 10 states increased their respective minimum wages. The exception was Nevada.
